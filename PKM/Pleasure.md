## Pleasure through pain

#Hormesis : _to set in motion_ (greek)
If you press on to the pain side of the balance as the initial stimulus, you trigger the body own re-regulating homeostating response. You start more of your own #dopamine. Physiologically it's a better way to get dopamine. It's not from the initial stimulus, it is from the secondary re-regulating effect, that's a lot more healthier and a lot more enduring. Because it's not vulnerable to the same tolerance, to the same rapid rate. 

__Pressing on the pain side of the balance__ anything requiring effort. Something painful and hard to do. Build mental calluses to be more resiliant if the face of future pain, and leads to more dopamine.
Examples:
- exercise
- creative challenging, with the proper amount of effort required
- reading a difficult text
- forcing yourself to do something that causes you anxiety, or that you are afraid of.
