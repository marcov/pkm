# About Success

## [[Eric Hoffer]]
> There are many who find a good alibi far more attractive than [[achievement]]. For an achievement does not settle anything permanently. We still have to prove our worth anew each day; we have to prove that we are as good today as we were yesterday. But when we have a valid alibi for not achieving anything we are fixed, so to speak, for life.

## [[Morgan Housel]]
> [[Success]] has a nasty tendency to increase [[confidence]] more than ability. The longer it lasts, and the more it was tied to some degree of serendipity, the truer that becomes.

> [[Decline]] occurs because many people's entire goal is to become so successful that they can relax, and relaxing leads to [[complacency]] that breeds decline.
