# About Happiness

We tend to grossly overestimate the pleasure brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones. While travel is a fantastic way to gain insight into unfamiliar cultures and illuminating ways of life, it is not a cure for discontentment of the mind.

[[Gratitude]] is what allows you to feel that same sense of wonderment about your day-to-day life as you would if you were walking the streets of a faraway city.

[[Love]] and [[work]] are crucial for human [[Happiness]] because, when done well, they draw us out of ourselves and into connection with people and projects beyond ourselves. Happiness comes from getting these connections right.

## [[Ben Felix]]
>If buying a [[home]] will make you happy, there few good arguments against it ("Renting vs. investing").
> Are home owners happier than renters?
> People are really bad at forecasting what will make them happy in the future, *particularly when it comes to major purchases.*
> Extrinsic goals: [[Money]], [[fame]], [[image]], [[status]]. Extrinsically motivated people are *less* happy in general.
