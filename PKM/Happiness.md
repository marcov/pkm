# About Happiness

## [[Lawrence Yeo]]
> We tend to grossly overestimate the pleasure brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones. While travel is a fantastic way to gain insight into unfamiliar cultures and illuminating ways of life, it is not a cure for discontentment of the mind.

> [[Gratitude]] is what allows you to feel that same sense of wonderment about your day-to-day life as you would if you were walking the streets of a faraway city.

> [[Love]] and [[work]] are crucial for human [[happiness]] because, when done well, they draw us out of ourselves and into connection with people and projects beyond ourselves. Happiness comes from getting these connections right.

## [[Ben Felix]]
> If buying a [[home]] will make you happy, there few good arguments against it ("Renting vs. investing").

> Are home owners happier than renters? No...

> People are really bad at forecasting what will make them happy in the future, *particularly when it comes to major purchases.*

> Extrinsic goals: [[Money]], [[fame]], [[image]], [[status]]. Extrinsically motivated people are *less* happy in general.

> [[Hedonic Adaptation]]: hedonicly adapt to their circumstances. A change in circumstances does not have a lasting impact in how we feel.

> Better to make small frequent experiential [[purchases]] rather than few big material ones: leads to persistent happiness we do not adapt to.

> We do not adapt to: debt, commuting in traffic.
