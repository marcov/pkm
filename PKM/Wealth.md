# About Wealth

## [[Ben Carlson]]
> To me, the highest form of [[Wealth]] is controlling your [[Time]].

> [[Happiness]]
> - Desiring [[Money]] beyond what you need to be [[happy]] is just an accounting hobby.
> - How much [[Money]] people need to be happy is driven more by [[expectations]] than income.

## [[Morgan Housel]] 
> Financial wellbeing canâ€™t be measured by merely looking at how much you earn. The gap between what you earn and how much you avoid offsetting those earnings is the figure that matters most.

## [[Naval]]
> Seek wealth, not [[Money]] or status. 
> - Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. 
> - Money is how we transfer time and wealth. 
> - Status is your place in the social hierarchy

> [[Status]] is a zero sum game. Wealth is a positive sum game.

## [[JL Collins]]
> Wealth is Security and Freedom.
