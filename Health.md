The main mental effect of [[testosterone]], is that if makes effort feels good
For most species, the males never gets a chance to mate. They have to fight for the right.
Males have to overcome the fear of pain and punishment, and the surge in T is what causes the shift in the willingness to engage in battle.
With T, effort makes the body feel good, it's a drive. It's a cognitive thing. 
When T depleted, you feel depressed, surge of T is a relief of anxiety.

Estrogen is what masculinizes the male brain. Gyno, etc... is caused by excessive levels of prolactin.
No include E blockers when doing TRT, they have very bad effect on the vascularity of the brain.
You want E for longevity and health of brain.
[[Dopamine]] inhibits prolactin. Dopamine with T goes hand in hand.
When you have a win, you release more dopamine, and T goes up a little bit.

DHT: bald vs beard (inverse effect)
Deca: anabolic but not androgenic

## #Peter_Attia Zone 2 training

Ways to figure out Zone 2:
- 80% of max HR
- 180 - your age (underestimated)
- Corresponds to lower zone 3 for power zones, where FTP is uppper Z4

For me Z2 is around 155 bpm / 170w.
