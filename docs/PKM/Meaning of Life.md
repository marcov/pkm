Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life:
- We must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal
- A man has to BE something; he has to matter.
- But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.
- But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.

When it comes to living a meaningful life, the only scoreboard that matters is yours. Don't let your ego get in the way of the person you really want to be.
