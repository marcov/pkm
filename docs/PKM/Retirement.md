# About Retirement
## #Naval
Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow.

Three ways to retire:

- #passive_income
- burn rate to 0
- do something you love. You enjoy it so much it's not about the [[Money]]

Be authentic. Do the thing that you know doing better than anybody else. Map that to what society actually wants.
