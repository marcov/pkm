There are many who find a good alibi far more attractive than achievement.
For an achievement does not settle anything permanently. We still have to prove
our worth anew each day; we have to prove that we are as good today as we were
yesterday. But when we have a valid alibi for not achieving anything we are fixed,
so to speak, for life.

[[Success]] has a nasty tendency to increase confidence more than ability.
The longer it lasts, and the more it was tied to some degree of serendipity,
the truer that becomes.

Decline occurs because many people's entire goal is to become so successful
that they can relax, and relaxing leads to [[complacency]] that breeds decline.

Convinzioni Limitanti: per il solo fatto di credere ad esse, ci predisponiamo
a non agire, a non metterci in gioco. E' invece molto utile ribaltarle e metterle
in discussione.

The most overlooked strategy for success is patience.

The best things compound over small gains over [[Time]]. The longer the horizon,
the larger the success.

In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are
as good as your consistency.
