But what I value far more is to be wealthy,
because I think independence is one of the
only ways money can make you happier.
The trick is realizing that the only way to
maintain independence is if your appetite
for stuff - including status - can be
satiated. The goalpost has to stop moving;
the expectations have to remain in check.
Otherwise money has a tendency to be a
liability masquerading as an asset,
controlling you more than you use it to
live a better life.
