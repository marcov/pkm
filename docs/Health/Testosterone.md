From #Huberman: https://ogjre.com/episode/1683-andrew-huberman

- The main mental effect of [[testosterone]], is that if makes effort feels good
- For most species, the males never gets a chance to mate. They have to fight for the right.
- Males have to overcome the fear of pain and punishment, and the surge in T is what causes the shift in the willingness to engage in battle.
- With T, effort makes the body feel good, it's a drive. It's a cognitive thing.
- When T depleted, you feel depressed, surge of T is a relief of anxiety.

- Estrogen is what masculinizes the male brain. Gyno, etc... is caused by excessive levels of prolactin.
- No include E blockers when doing TRT, they have very bad effect on the vascularity of the brain.
- You want E for longevity and health of brain.
- [[Dopamine]] inhibits prolactin. Dopamine with T goes hand in hand.
- When you have a win, you release more dopamine, and T goes up a little bit.

- DHT: bald vs beard (inverse effect)
- Deca: anabolic but not androgenic
