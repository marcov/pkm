The problem with #desire is that there's always a next.
Whatever kind of fulfilment you have, there's more to be had.

Meditate:

- You become a bit less materialistic
- Find the space where I am content
- The desire not only dictate your action
- Guilt / shame / desire controls you less

---

- The structure of life is based on #ambitions, accomplishments and triumphs
- Society tries to create materialistic needs

When you meditate this goes away. Ambition and desire is what sources your
motivations. You start living life when you stop chasing desire. You are
content with yourself. Opportunity cost shrinks. Benefit of meditation, as you
learn to be content within yourself, you can enjoy without being influenced by
desire.

It's the same, you are equally content with or without something.

Engage in life, experiment, see what else is out there. Live life from this
perspective. It becomes less important whether I do something in one way or the
other. It becomes enjoyment. Life transform into something called "Lila"
(reality or play). You can choose freely. You start playing the game of life.
You become free from the constrain of desire.

The mind of a meditator can never classify.
