> We tend to grossly overestimate the [[Pleasure]] brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones. While travel is a fantastic way to gain insight into unfamiliar cultures and illuminating ways of life, it is not a cure for discontentment of the mind.

> [[Gratitude]] is what allows you to feel that same sense of wonderment about your day-to-day life as you would if you were walking the streets of a faraway city.

> [[Love]] and [[work]] are crucial for [[human]] [[happiness]] because, when done well, they draw us out of ourselves and into connection with people and projects beyond ourselves. Happiness comes from getting these connections right.

> If buying a [[home]] will make you happy, there few good arguments against it ("Renting vs. investing").

> Are home owners happier than renters? No...

> People are really bad at forecasting what will make them happy in the future, *particularly when it comes to major purchases.*

> Extrinsic goals: [[Money]], [[fame]], [[image]], [[status]]. Extrinsically motivated people are *less* happy in general.

> [[Hedonic Adaptation]]: hedonicly adapt to their circumstances. A change in circumstances does not have a lasting impact in how we feel.

> Better to make small frequent experiential [[purchases]] rather than few big material ones: leads to persistent happiness we do not adapt to.

> We do not adapt to: debt, commuting in traffic.

> PERMA:
> - Positive Emotions

## #Morgan_Housel
> Expectations rise equal or faster than results, leading to constant disappointment no matter how much youâ€™ve accomplished.
Managing expectations and getting the goalpost to stop moving is one of the hardest trick in life.

> There are two ways to measure how you are doing: against yourself and against others
You can be much happier if your understand that the internal benchmark are much more important than the external ones
External benchmarks are deceiving, since you only see the wins, but not all the failures and the ugly things.

> Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.
Just get one or two desires in life, and focus on those. Do not get distracted by thousand of desires.
