>Your real resume is just a catalog of your own suffering.

>At death, what are the interesting thing you have done? It's all going to be about the sacrifices you did, the hard thing you did. What you are given does not matter.

Victim mentality: it's somebody else fault. Those people are sinking. Change the way they approach the reality.

**Life is a single player game** Whatever you think / believe, will shape your reality.
If you're walking down the street and you are judging everyone, the more you judge the more you are separating yourself. You will feel good at the instant about yourself, **but then you're going to feel lonely**, and you are going to see negativity everywhere. The world reflects your own feelings back.

I slowly work every negative judgement that I have, until I see the positive.

Happy thoughts disappears out the heads immediately. **Watch your mind, watch your thoughts**. Why are you having these thought. When you understand something, it naturally calms you down.

Hence, [[Happiness]] is a choice. If you believe it's a choice, then you can start working towards it.

Confucio:
- Every man has two lifes. And the second starts when you realize there's only one!

A happy person wants 1000 things. A sick person just wants one thing. Unlimited desires clouds your desire.
**Have desires, but be very careful. Desire is suffering** Don't focus on more than 1 desire at the [[Time]].

Would I still be interested in learning this thing if I couldn't ever tell anybody about it.
