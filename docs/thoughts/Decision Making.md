Part of making effective decisions boils down to _dealing with reality._ That means:

- Not having a strong sense of self.
- Not having preconceived notions of how things should be.

Moment of suffering = moment when you see exactly things the way they are.
Moment of suffering = moment of truth.

Seeing the truth: get your ego out of the way, because your ego does not want you to face the truth.
The smaller you make your ego, the easier it will be to see the reality

What _we wish_ to be true: clouds the perception of what _it is really_ true.
E.g. when you advise a friend. You don't have your ego  / desire clouding perceptions. Giving the correct advice is easy.
For the friend, the problem is the reality colliding with his desired and preventing them to see the truth.

If something is _NOT_ going well, I will try to acknowledge it in public in front of the others. 
If I do not not hide it from anybody else, I am not going to delude myself from what's actually going on.o

It's very important to uncondition yourself. 
Take habits that you have. Is that habit something you preconditioned and reinforced by yourself, and say it is "part of your identity"?
**Does it still serve you**? Is it making you smarter, happier?
Make habits more deliberate.


I do not like to self-identify on almost any level anymore. This is to avoid having beliefs that are not evaluated.
Any belief that you took as a package should be re-evaluated using the base principles.
